# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++.

## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If no player achieves this and the grid is full, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Player vs Player:** The game supports two players taking turns to play.
- **Grid Display:** The current state of the game board is displayed after each move.
- **Win Detection:** The game detects when a player has won and displays the winner.
- **Draw Detection:** If the grid is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Usage

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
4. Players take turns entering the position they want to mark.
5. The game ends when one player wins or when there's a draw.

## How to Play

- When prompted, enter the position number where you want to place your mark.
- The grid is numbered as follows:
1 | 2 | 3
4 | 5 | 6
7 | 8 | 9


- Each player's mark is represented as 'X' or 'O'.
- The game will display the current state of the grid after each move.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all positions are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
